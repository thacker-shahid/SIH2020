She comes from a <span class="important">background</span> in which female education is considered sinful, and Suparna had to overcome incredible obstacles in order to complete her formal education. She had to face the <span class="important">objections</span> of her family, and <span class="important">repressive societal expectations </span>, in order to create an independent identity for herself. But she persevered, and after completing her<span class="important"> Master’s </span>, Suparna found a life partner who supported her goals and ambitions. <span class=important> 2016 however, her son fell critically ill, and she stopped working in order to care for him</span>. Returning to the workforce was difficult—technology moves so fast, and she didn’t know how to fit back into the job market. But as a<span class="important"> Google Developer Scholarship recipient, she is now engaged in an intensive learning program, and looking forward to using her new skills not just in her own life, but to uplift others in situations similar to what she’s had to overcome.</span>
