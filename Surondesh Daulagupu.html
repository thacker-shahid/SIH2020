    <p class="style"><span class="important">Surondesh Daulagupu</span> comes from a small town in <span class="important"> Assam called Langting</span>. By the time he reached the 11th grade, his life was already on a troublesome path. He had addiction problems, and<span class="important"> he failed his 12th board exams</span>. There was no going back to fix the problems he’d caused for himself, and with a poor scorecard,<span class="important">there were no opportunities ahead for him to get into a good undergraduate college</span>. Things could have gotten much worse, but instead, Surondesh had an epiphany—he realized he needed to break free once and for all from his past, and from his problems.<span class="important"> He committed to learning on his own, and started studying Android development with Udacity</span>. As he learned new skills, his confidence grew. He decided to try and earn a Google Developer Scholarship, and was successful!<span class="important"> Today, he is honing his Android developer skills, and looking forward to landing a good job </span>. Genuine transformation isn’t easy, but Surondesh shows us it’s possible.
